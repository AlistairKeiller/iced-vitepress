# Setup

This section will guide you through the process of setting up an application with Iced.

## Create Project

After you have [installed cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html), create a new project with `cargo`:

```bash
cargo new my_app
```

Add iced as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
iced = "0.4.2"
```
